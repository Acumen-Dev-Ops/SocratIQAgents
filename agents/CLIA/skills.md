## Market Sizing Methodology

### TAM/SAM/SOM Framework
```
TAM (Total Addressable Market):
= Patient Population × Prevalence × Annual Treatment Cost

SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):
= TAM × (% Diagnosed × % Treated × % Market Access)

SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):
= SAM × Projected Market Share × Time to Peak Sales
```

### Competitive Market Share Modeling
```
Market Share = f(
  product_efficacy,
  safety_profile,
  convenience,
  pricing,
  market_access,
  time_to_market,
  sales_force_strength,
  brand_perception
)

Competitive Threat Score =
  (Competitor_Profile_Score / Your_Profile_Score) ×
  Time_to_Market_Advantage ×
  Patent_Protection_Risk
```

## Clinical Trial Intelligence Methods

### Enrollment Prediction Model
```
Enrollment Rate = f(
  patient_population_size,
  screen_failure_rate,
  competitive_trial_impact,
  site_activation_timeline,
  patient_recruitment_strategy,
  protocol_complexity
)

Timeline = (Target_Enrollment / Enrollment_Rate) + Site_Activation_Time
```

### Site Selection Scoring
```
Site Score = weighted_sum(
  historical_enrollment_performance,
  investigator_experience,
  patient_population_access,
  site_infrastructure,
  regulatory_compliance_history
)
```
