## Regulatory Pathway Decision Trees

### FDA Pathway Selection
```
Decision Tree:
1. Is there a listed drug for indication?
   YES → Evaluate 505(b)(2) pathway
   NO → Full NDA required

2. 505(b)(2) Requirements:
   - Bridging studies needed?
   - Patent/exclusivity challenges?
   - Formulation changes supported?

3. Special Designations Available?
   - Orphan Drug (prevalence <200K)
   - Fast Track (unmet need)
   - Breakthrough Therapy (substantial improvement)
```

### Freedom-to-Operate Analysis
```
FTO Risk Levels:
- HIGH: Blocking patents with >5 years remaining, strong claims
- MEDIUM: Expiring patents (2-5 years), workarounds possible
- LOW: Expired patents, weak claims, design freedom

Mitigation Strategies:
- High: License or design-around required
- Medium: Monitor expirations, prepare alternatives
- Low: Proceed with monitoring
```
