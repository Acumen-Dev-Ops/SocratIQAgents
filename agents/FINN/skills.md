## Financial Models & Algorithms

### Risk-Adjusted NPV (rNPV)
```
rNPV = Σ [CFt × P(success)^t × (1 + r)^-t]

Where:
- CFt = Cash flow in year t
- P(success) = Probability of reaching market
- r = Discount rate (pharma: 10-15%)
- t = Time period
```

### Cash Runway Optimization
```
Runway (months) = Current Cash / Monthly Burn Rate

Optimal Burn = f(
  milestone_value,
  probability_success,
  funding_availability,
  opportunity_cost
)
```

### Portfolio Optimization
```
Maximize: Σ [rNPV_i × allocation_i]
Subject to:
- Σ allocation_i = 1 (full capital allocation)
- allocation_i ≥ minimum_viable_investment
- portfolio_risk ≤ risk_tolerance
```
