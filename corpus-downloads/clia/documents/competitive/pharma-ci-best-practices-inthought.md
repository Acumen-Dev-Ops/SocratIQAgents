## CI Process Framework

inThought Research outlines a structured approach to pharma CI centered on systematic monitoring and knowledge management. The process begins with "a well-defined approach" to determine your specific market focus:

### Market Focus Definition
1. **Broad Therapeutic Area**: Oncology, cardiology, neurology, etc.
2. **Niche Indication**: Specific disease states or rare diseases
3. **Specific Molecule Type**: Small molecules, biologics, gene therapies

The framework emphasizes establishing "**a centralized portal for team members to contribute their findings**" to maintain organizational alignment.

## Systematic Approaches

### 1. Conference Strategy

**Pre-Conference**:
- Identify top-tier conferences for therapeutic area
- Plan attendance and coverage
- Assign team members to specific sessions/tracks

**During Conference**:
- Attend presentations and poster sessions
- Conduct daily team debriefs
- Monitor social media reactions (#hashtags, Twitter/LinkedIn)
- Network with KOLs and competitors

**Post-Conference**:
- Generate comprehensive conference report
- Synthesize key insights and implications
- Distribute findings to stakeholders
- Update competitive intelligence database

### 2. Clinical Trial Monitoring

**Subscription Services**:
- ClinicalTrials.gov alerts
- Commercial trial tracking databases
- Real-time trial status updates

**Manual Monitoring**:
- Competitive trial enrollments and completions
- Unexpected trial results (positive or negative)
- Protocol amendments and design changes
- Investigator site lists and performance

**Outcomes Research**:
- Real-world evidence publications
- Health economics studies
- Patient-reported outcomes data

### 3. Centralized Repository Implementation

**Platform Requirements**:
- Searchable database
- Organized collection and categorization
- Interpretation and analysis tools
- Standardized distribution formats

**Content Types**:
- Regular reports (weekly/monthly/quarterly)
- Real-time alerts for critical developments

## CLIA Agent Application

### CLIA Sub-Agent Mapping

#### CLIA-Competitive
- **Primary Use**: Systematic CI process framework
- **KOL Tracking**: Multi-domain identification and relationship building
- **Conference Intelligence**: Pre/during/post conference strategy

#### CLIA-Clinical
- **Primary Use**: Clinical trial monitoring methodology
- **Trial Registry Analysis**: ClinicalTrials.gov tracking
- **Enrollment Forecasting**: Competitive trial impact assessment

#### CLIA-Market
- **Primary Use**: Standard of care development tracking
- **Market Share Analysis**: Prescribing pattern monitoring
- **Payer Intelligence**: Policy update tracking

### Practical Query Example

**Query**: "What is our competitor's Phase 3 trial status and how does it threaten our market position?"

**CLIA-Competitive Analysis** (using this framework):

1. **Clinical Trial Monitoring**:
   - Check ClinicalTrials.gov for competitor trial NCT number
   - Status: Active, enrolling (estimated completion Q3 2026)
   - Enrollment: 450 patients (target 600) = 75% enrolled
   - Investigator sites: 45 sites (15 overlap with our sites)

2. **KOL Tracking**:
   - Principal Investigator: Dr. [Name] - Tier 1 KOL in therapeutic area
   - 5 of top 10 KOLs in our therapeutic area participating in competitor trial
   - KOL social media sentiment: Positive about competitor data

3. **Conference Intelligence**:
   - Competitor presenting Phase 2b data at ASH (December 2025)
   - Anticipated positive data readout based on conference abstracts
   - Investor analyst reports projecting $500M peak sales

4. **Centralized Repository Check**:
   - Historical competitor trial timeline: 18-24 months for Phase 3
   - Expected approval: Q4 2027 / Q1 2028
   - Market entry threat timeline: 2-3 years

5. **Strategic Assessment**:
   - **Threat Level**: HIGH
   - **Rationale**: Strong KOL engagement, overlapping trial sites, positive sentiment
   - **Market Impact**: 30-40% market share at risk if approved
   - **Recommended Actions**:
     - Accelerate our Phase 3 timeline by 6 months (coordinate with VERA-Clinical)
     - Engage competing KOLs for our advisory board (coordinate with VERA-Strategic)
     - Prepare comparative efficacy messaging (coordinate with FINN-Partnerships for market access)

**Output**: "Competitor Phase 3 trial is 75% enrolled (450/600 patients) with expected Q3 2026 completion. HIGH threat level due to strong KOL engagement and 15 overlapping sites. Recommend accelerating our trial by 6 months and engaging competitive KOLs. Estimated market share impact: 30-40% if competitor approved first."
