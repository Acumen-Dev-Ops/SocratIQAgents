---

## Definition & Core Concept

Risk-adjusted NPV (rNPV) modifies traditional net present value by incorporating "probability of success at each development stage" into the valuation model. This approach specifically addresses biotech's unique challenges: prolonged development timelines, regulatory uncertainty, and high failure rates.

## The rNPV Formula

```
rNPV = Σ (Expected Cash Flow in Year t × Probability of Success) / (1 + r)^t
```

**Where**:
- **Expected Cash Flow** = revenue minus all costs (R&D, COGS, SG&A)
- **Probability of Success** = cumulative success rate from current stage to market approval
- **r** = discount rate (typically 10-15% for biotech)
- **t** = time in years

## Probability of Success by Development Stage

Historical success rates guide probability weighting:

| Development Stage | Success Rate to Next Stage | Cumulative POS to Approval |
|-------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Preclinical** | ~30% | ~5-10% |
| **Phase I** | ~63% | ~10-15% |
| **Phase II** | ~31% | ~20-30% |
| **Phase III** | ~58% | ~50-70% |
| **FDA Approval** | ~85% | ~85-95% |

**Cumulative Probability Calculation**: Multiply sequentially.

**Example**: Phase II asset probability to market = 0.31 (Phase II success) × 0.58 (Phase III success) × 0.85 (FDA approval) = **~15% cumulative POS**

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Define Asset Timeline
Map the drug's current development stage and expected progression through clinical phases to approval.

### 2. Estimate Market Potential
- Calculate target patient population size
- Model market penetration assumptions
- Determine pricing per patient annually
- Project treatment duration
- Build revenue ramp-up post-approval (typically 20%, 40%, 70%, 100% over 4 years)

### 3. Forecast Future Cash Flows
Project 10-15 years of revenues and costs including:
- **COGS**: 5-20% for biologics
- **SG&A**: 20-30% of revenue
- **Post-approval R&D expenses**
- **Royalty payments** (if licensed)

### 4. Apply Probability Weights
Adjust each year's cash flows by appropriate cumulative probability based on development stage.

### 5. Discount to Present Value
Apply discount rate reflecting biotech sector risk and cost of capital.

### 6. Sum Discounted Cash Flows
Total present value equals rNPV.

## Worked Example: Phase II Oncology Asset

**Assumptions:**
- Peak sales: $500 million annually
- Success probability (Phase II → Approval): 15%
- Net margin: 60%
- Discount rate: 12%
- 4-year ramp to peak sales

| Year | Projected Cash Flow | Probability-Adjusted CF | Present Value (PV) at 12% |
|------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| 6 | $100M | $15M | $8.49M |
| 7 | $200M | $30M | $14.25M |
| 8 | $300M | $45M | $19.27M |
| 9 | $300M | $45M | $17.20M |
| 10 | $300M | $45M | $15.36M |

**Simplified Result**: ~$120 million rNPV (partial calculation for illustration)

## rNPV vs. Traditional DCF

| Feature | DCF | rNPV |
|---------|-----|------|
| **Assumes certainty** | Yes | No |
| **Adjusts for clinical failure risk** | No | Yes |
| **Best suited for** | Mature, revenue-generating companies | Clinical-stage biotech |
| **Risk incorporation** | Discount rate only | Probability × discount rate |
| **Valuation accuracy for biotech** | Often overvalues | More realistic |

**Key Insight**: Traditional DCF typically "overvalue[s]" pre-revenue biotech by ignoring development risk, while rNPV provides "a more conservative, realistic picture."

## Discount Rate Selection

Biotech discount rates (10-15%) incorporate:
- Time value of money
- Cost of capital in high-risk sectors
- Development timeline uncertainty
- Commercial risk (competitive landscape, pricing pressure)

**Best Practice**:
- Higher rates (12-15%) for earlier-stage assets
- Lower rates (8-12%) as assets approach regulatory approvals
- Do NOT use 30-60% rates (that's for DCF without POS adjustment)

## Critical Limitations

### 1. Reliance on Historical Averages
- Historical success rates may not reflect company-specific differentiation
- Asset-specific factors (e.g., breakthrough therapy designation) can improve POS

### 2. Binary Outcome Modeling
- Assumes failure equals zero value
- Ignores partial successes (e.g., label expansions, secondary indications)

### 3. Input Sensitivity
- Small changes in probability or timing significantly alter valuations
- Sensitivity analysis is critical

### 4. Strategic Value Gaps
- Market perception and M&A potential may not be fully captured
- Synergies and strategic positioning not quantified

**Best Practice**: Layer rNPV with:
- Scenario analysis (best/base/worst case)
- Real options valuation (value of flexibility)
- Comparable transaction reviews (market validation)

## Industry Application

rNPV serves as the foundation for:
- **M&A Due Diligence**: Buyer/seller valuation negotiations
- **Licensing and Partnership Negotiations**: Deal term structuring
- **Venture Capital Funding Decisions**: Investment sizing and valuation
- **Internal Strategic Planning**: Portfolio prioritization

Investment firms and pharmaceutical business development teams rely on rNPV to "assess whether a biotech asset justifies its price tag."

## FINN Agent Application

### FINN Sub-Agent Mapping
- **FINN-Exit**: Asset valuation for M&A, licensing, partnerships
- **FINN-ROI**: Project prioritization using rNPV expected values
- **FINN-Risk**: Sensitivity analysis and scenario modeling
- **FINN-Budget**: Cash flow forecasting and burn rate optimization

### Practical Query Example
**Query**: "What is the fair value of our Phase 2 rare disease asset?"

**FINN-Exit Analysis** (using this methodology):
1. **Market Potential**:
   - Patient population: 25,000 globally (coordinates with CLIA-Market)
   - Pricing: $200K/year net price
   - Peak sales: $1.68B (at 70% penetration)

2. **Probability of Success**:
   - Phase 2 → Approval: 35% (rare disease, above 30-40% benchmark)
   - Adjustment for orphan drug designation: +5% (total 40%)

3. **Cash Flow Forecast**:
   - Development cost: $80M remaining
   - Time to approval: 5 years
   - Revenue ramp: Years 6-10 (20%, 40%, 70%, 100%, 100%)

4. **rNPV Calculation**:
   - Discount rate: 12% (mid-stage project)
   - NPV before risk adjustment: $850M
   - Risk-adjusted NPV: $850M × 0.40 = **$340M**

5. **Sensitivity Analysis**:
   - If POS = 30%: rNPV = $255M
   - If POS = 50%: rNPV = $425M

**Output**: "Fair valuation range $300M-$380M based on rNPV with 35-40% POS. Comparable Phase 2 rare disease deals at 0.6-0.8x rNPV suggest transaction value $180M-$300M."

## Key Takeaways for FINN Agent

1. **rNPV is the gold standard** - Not DCF - for pre-revenue biotech valuation
2. **Separate clinical risk (POS) from commercial risk (discount rate)** - Do not double-count risk
3. **Use asset-specific POS** - Not just historical averages - when possible
4. **Always run sensitivity analysis** - rNPV is highly sensitive to input changes
5. **Layer with other methodologies** - rNPV + scenarios + comparables = robust valuation
