## Integration with Production Architecture

### Lambda Function Updates Required

Once corpus is uploaded to S3, update Lambda environment variables:

```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name SocratIQ-AskSophie \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --environment Variables="{
    VERA_CORPUS_BUCKET=socratiq-vera-corpus-prod,
    FINN_CORPUS_BUCKET=socratiq-finn-corpus-prod,
    NORA_CORPUS_BUCKET=socratiq-nora-corpus-prod,
    CLIA_CORPUS_BUCKET=socratiq-clia-corpus-prod,
    SOPHIE_CORPUS_BUCKET=socratiq-sophie-corpus-prod,
    ENABLE_CORPUS_RETRIEVAL=true
  }"
```

### Agent Service Integration Pattern

Each agent service will:

1. **Receive user query** (e.g., "How can we improve enrollment?")
2. **Semantic search S3 corpus** for relevant documents
3. **Retrieve top 3 documents** with highest relevance scores
4. **Pass to Claude 3.5 Sonnet** with:
   - User query
   - Retrieved document context
   - Agent-specific prompt engineering
5. **Generate response** with source citations
6. **Log to Trace™** for audit trail

**Example Response Format**:
```
Based on a 2024 PMC peer-reviewed study of clinical trial recruitment strategies,
implementing a multimodal approach combining in-person recruitment (100% completion rate),
referral programs (100% completion rate), and text messaging (98% read rate) can
accelerate enrollment by 40-60%.

The study found that 80% of clinical trials experience delays due to poor recruitment,
but multimodal strategies successfully achieved enrollment targets without timeline
extensions.

Recommended actions:
1. Prioritize in-person recruitment at high-performing sites
2. Implement referral incentives for enrolled patients
3. Use SMS for appointment reminders and updates (98% read rate vs 22% for email)

Expected enrollment acceleration: 50% based on evidence-based best practices.
