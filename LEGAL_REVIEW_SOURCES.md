## Best Practices for Legal Compliance

### 1. Attribution Requirements

For ALL sources, include structured citations:

```markdown
**Source**: [Organization/Author]
**URL**: [Direct link]
**Date**: [Publication date]
**License**: [If applicable - CC-BY, Fair Use, Public Domain]
**Usage**: [How we're using it - extracted methodologies, cited statistics, etc.]
```

### 2. Fair Use Guidelines

When using copyrighted content under fair use:

✅ **DO**:
- Extract facts, data, and methodologies (not copyrightable)
- Summarize key concepts in your own words
- Use < 10% of original content as excerpts
- Add transformative value (analysis, synthesis with other sources)
- Cite original source with URL

❌ **DON'T**:
- Reproduce entire articles or large sections verbatim
- Copy proprietary frameworks without transformation
- Use content in a way that substitutes for purchasing original
- Remove copyright notices or attribution

### 3. Government Works

✅ U.S. Government works (FDA, NIH, ClinicalTrials.gov) are public domain:
- Free to use, reproduce, and distribute
- No permission required
- Attribution recommended as best practice
- Must not imply government endorsement

### 4. Transformative Use

Our use is **transformative** because:
- We're synthesizing multiple sources into agent knowledge bases
- We're extracting methodologies and applying to pharmaceutical decision support
- We're creating structured metadata and cross-references
- We're enabling AI-powered analysis (not just republishing content)

This strengthens fair use defense.

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Actions (Before S3 Upload)

1. ✅ **Add License Metadata** to all documents:
   ```markdown
   **Legal Status**: [Public Domain / Fair Use / Open Access]
   **Attribution**: [Required / Recommended]
   **Restrictions**: [None / Do not reproduce verbatim / Cite as secondary source]
   ```

2. ✅ **Update Gartner Citation**:
   - Change from direct reference to "as cited in IQVIA blog (2025)"
   - Do NOT attempt to download Gartner reports

3. ✅ **Verify PMC Licenses**:
   - Check specific CC license for PMC11348161 and PMC11889410
   - Confirm CC-BY or CC-BY-NC allows our use

4. ✅ **Add Disclaimer** to corpus documentation:
   ```markdown
   ## Legal Disclaimer

   All sources used in the SocratIQ agent corpus are either:
   1. U.S. Government works (public domain)
   2. Open access publications with appropriate licenses
   3. Publicly available content used under fair use for educational purposes

   Where applicable, sources are cited with full attribution. Facts, data, and
   methodologies extracted are not subject to copyright protection.

   This corpus is for internal research and development purposes to enhance
   pharmaceutical decision support systems.
   ```

### Long-Term Actions

1. **Maintain Attribution Log**: Track all sources with licenses and usage
2. **Monitor Terms of Use**: Check for changes to website terms annually
3. **Legal Review**: Have corporate counsel review corpus before commercial launch
4. **Licensing Strategy**: Consider purchasing enterprise licenses for key sources (e.g., BiopharmaVantage) if heavily used
