## 🚀 Deploy in 3 Steps

### **Step 1: Verify Prerequisites** ✅
```bash
# Check AWS CLI
aws --version

# Check Node.js
node --version  # Should be v20.x

# Check AWS credentials
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

### **Step 2: Run Deployment Script** 🎯

**On Windows (PowerShell)**:
```powershell
cd infrastructure\lambda
.\deploy-agents.ps1
```

**On Linux/Mac (Bash)**:
```bash
cd infrastructure/lambda
chmod +x deploy-agents.sh
./deploy-agents.sh
```

### **Step 3: Test Your Agents** 🧪

The deployment script will output Lambda ARNs. Test them:

```bash
# Test VERA agent
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name SocratIQ-VERA-Agent-prod \
  --payload '{"query":"What enrollment strategy for Phase 3 trials?"}' \
  response.json

# Test Sophie orchestrator
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name SocratIQ-Sophie-Orchestrator-prod \
  --payload '{"message":"Should I pursue CRADA with NIH?"}' \
  response.json
```

## 📊 What Gets Deployed

| Component | Description | Time |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| **Shared Layer** | Common utilities, Bedrock client, corpus retrieval | 2 min |
| **VERA Agent** | Product & Clinical Intelligence | 2 min |
| **FINN Agent** | Financial & Investment Intelligence | 2 min |

**Total Deployment Time**: ~15 minutes ⏱️

---

## 🎯 What You Can Do Immediately

### **1. Single-Agent Queries**
Ask specialized questions to individual agents:

**VERA** (Product & Clinical):
- "What's the best enrollment strategy for Phase 3 oncology trials?"
- "Should I use a companion diagnostic for patient selection?"
- "What CMC strategy for biologic scale-up?"

**FINN** (Financial):
- "What's the rNPV for my Phase 2 rare disease asset?"
- "What's a fair M&A valuation range?"
- "How should I structure licensing deal terms?"

**NORA** (Regulatory & Legal):
- "Should I pursue 505(b)(2) or BLA pathway?"
- "What are the CRADA IP terms I should negotiate?"
- "What's the regulatory risk for accelerated approval?"

**CLIA** (Market & Trials):
- "What's the competitive landscape for JAK inhibitors?"
- "What's the patient population for my indication?"
- "What CRO should I use for Phase 3 operations?"

### **2. Multi-Agent Strategic Decisions**
Ask Sophie to coordinate multiple agents:

**Parallel Invocation**:
- "What's the valuation and regulatory path for my asset?"
  → Sophie invokes FINN + NORA in parallel

**Sequential Invocation**:
- "Should I pursue CRADA with the NIH?"
  → Sophie invokes NORA (legal) → VERA (product benefits) → FINN (financial value)

**Complex Synthesis**:
- "What's the best strategic path for my Phase 2 rare disease program?"
  → Sophie invokes all 4 agents, synthesizes with tri-paradigm reasoning

## 🎨 Architecture Highlights

### **Sophie's Tri-Paradigm Reasoning™**

**1. Mechanistic Analysis** (Hard Constraints):
```
IF cash_runway < 18_months THEN BLOCK
IF safety_grade >= 4 THEN BLOCK
IF regulatory_violation THEN BLOCK
```

**2. Deterministic Scoring** (Strategic Options):
```
Option A: rNPV = $340M, Regulatory Risk = Medium → Score: 7.5/10
Option B: rNPV = $280M, Regulatory Risk = Low → Score: 8.0/10
RECOMMEND: Option B (lower risk, acceptable return)
```

**3. Probabilistic Risk Assessment** (Uncertainty):
```
Success Probability: 60-80% (Phase 2 → Approval)
Valuation Range: $300M-$380M (80% confidence)
Risk-Adjusted Recommendation: Pursue with $320M target valuation
```

### **Corpus-Enhanced Intelligence**
Every response is grounded in authoritative sources:
- ✅ 4 documents already deployed (clinical trials, financial models, CI frameworks, AI orchestration)
- ✅ 52 total sources identified and legally reviewed
- ✅ 100% attribution with metadata (source, legal status, date accessed)

### **24 Specialized Sub-Agents**
Keyword-based routing to domain experts:
- **VERA**: Product, Clinical, Biomarker, CMC, Strategic, Development
- **FINN**: Budget, Pricing, Exit, Partnerships, Risk, ROI
- **NORA**: Regulatory, IP, Legal, FedScout, Compliance, Intelligence
- **CLIA**: Market, Clinical, Timeline, Competitive, Operations
