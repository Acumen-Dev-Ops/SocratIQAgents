## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Sophie as Central Orchestrator
**Decision**: All user queries go through Sophie first
**Rationale**:
- Single point of coordination for multi-agent responses
- Enables tri-paradigm synthesis across all agents
- Simplifies API Gateway integration
- Maintains complete audit trail

### 2. Separate Lambda Functions per Agent
**Decision**: 5 distinct Lambda functions instead of monolith
**Rationale**:
- Independent scaling per agent
- Isolation of failures
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to update individual agents

### 3. S3 for Corpus Storage
**Decision**: One S3 bucket per agent for corpus documents
**Rationale**:
- Scalable and cost-effective
- Versioning for audit trails
- Easy to add new documents
- Secure with IAM policies

### 4. AWS Bedrock Claude 3.5 Sonnet
**Decision**: Use Bedrock instead of direct Anthropic API
**Rationale**:
- VPC integration (no internet egress)
- AWS native service (better IAM integration)
- Enterprise compliance (AWS PrivateLink)
- Cost optimization (Reserved Capacity available)

### 5. Simple Keyword Matching (Phase 1)
**Decision**: Term frequency for corpus retrieval instead of embeddings
**Rationale**:
- Fast to implement (6-day sprint constraint)
- Good enough for MVP (5 documents per agent)
- Can enhance with embeddings in Phase 2
- Reduces infrastructure complexity

### 6. Tri-Paradigm Reasoning Framework
**Decision**: Mechanistic → Deterministic → Probabilistic synthesis
**Rationale**:
- Matches pharmaceutical decision-making patterns
- Hard constraints checked first (safety/compliance)
- Scenario scoring provides clear options
- Probabilistic handles uncertainty professionally
- Differentiates from generic AI assistants
