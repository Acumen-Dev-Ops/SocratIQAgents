# SocratIQ Platform - Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**Version**: 3.0 UPDATED  
**Date**: October 9, 2025 9:00 AM EST  
**Status**: üöÄ Production Development - Two-Team Sprint Ready  
**Owner**: Acumen Analytics Product Team

## FedScout Architecture Decision (NEW)

### Strategic Positioning
**FedScout operates as a dual-domain capability**:
- **Primary Owner**: NORA-FedScout (legal/regulatory expertise)
- **Strategic Coordinator**: VERA-Development (product acceleration analysis)
- **Synthesis**: Sophie combines legal feasibility + strategic product value

### Cross-Agent Integration Example
```typescript
// FedScout cross-domain coordination
async function analyzeFederalOpportunity(asset: Asset): Promise<FedScoutAnalysis> {
  // NORA: Legal/regulatory feasibility
  const legalAnalysis = await NORA_FedScout.assessCRADA(asset);
  
  // VERA: Product development acceleration potential  
  const productImpact = await VERA_Development.evaluateFederalTech(asset, legalAnalysis.technologies);
  
  // FINN: Financial impact of acceleration
  const financialValue = await FINN_ROI.calculateAccelerationValue(productImpact.timelineSavings);
  
  return {
    legalFeasibility: legalAnalysis,
    productAcceleration: productImpact,
    financialImpact: financialValue,
    sophieRecommendation: "Pursue CRADA - 18-month acceleration worth $3M NPV"
  };
}
```

### Implementation Benefits
- **Preserved 4-agent architecture** (no additional complexity)
- **Clear domain ownership** (NORA handles legal/regulatory aspects)
- **Strategic value capture** (VERA coordinates product acceleration)
- **Future flexibility** (can extract to standalone agent if federal tech becomes major revenue driver)

## SophieLogic‚Ñ¢ Tri-Paradigm Reasoning Framework (NEW)

### Overview

**SophieLogic‚Ñ¢** implements three complementary AI reasoning paradigms for pharmaceutical decision synthesis:

### 1. Mechanistic AI (Rule-Based Domain Logic)
**Purpose**: Non-negotiable pharmaceutical constraints and regulatory requirements

```typescript
const PharmaDomainRules = {
  regulatory: {
    "safety_trumps_efficacy": true,
    "fda_guidance_mandatory": true,
    "adverse_events_halt": (severity) => severity > Grade_4
  },
  financial: {
    "cash_runway_minimum": 18, // months
    "phase3_cost_gate": (budget) => budget > 50_000_000
  },
  legal: {
    "ip_freedom_required": true,
    "regulatory_compliance_blocking": true
  }
};
```

### 2. Deterministic AI (Mathematical Scoring)
**Purpose**: Repeatable, auditable calculations for TxP profile optimization

```typescript
function calculateTxPScores(entities: Entity[]): TxPProfile {
  return {
    product: productScoringAlgorithm(entities),      // 0-10 scale
    regulatory: regulatoryScoringAlgorithm(entities), // 0-10 scale
    budget: budgetScoringAlgorithm(entities),         // 0-10 scale
    // ... 9 more profiles
    completeness: calculateCompleteness(entities)      // 0-100%
  };
}
```

### 3. Probabilistic AI (Uncertainty Quantification)
**Purpose**: Bayesian reasoning for pharmaceutical risk assessment and success prediction

```typescript
function predictAssetSuccess(asset: Asset): ProbabilityDistribution {
  const industryPrior = benchmarkData[asset.indication][asset.phase];
  const evidenceLikelihood = calculateEvidenceStrength(asset.data);
  const posteriorSuccess = bayesianUpdate(industryPrior, evidenceLikelihood);
  
  return {
    mean: posteriorSuccess.mean,
    confidenceInterval: posteriorSuccess.ci_95,
    uncertainty: posteriorSuccess.variance
  };
}
```

### Sophie Conflict Resolution

**Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) Framework**:
1. **Mechanistic Constraints**: Apply hard rules (regulatory, safety, legal)
2. **Deterministic Scoring**: Weight agent recommendations by query type
3. **Probabilistic Synthesis**: Quantify uncertainty and confidence intervals
4. **Unified Recommendation**: Combine all three paradigms into actionable guidance

7. **Regulatory Profile (RxP)**: FDA pathway optimization, international regulatory strategy, compliance, risk mitigation
8. **Investor Exit Profile (ExP)**: Exit timing, strategic buyer identification, valuation enhancement, transaction readiness

### Decision Framework (Dec 31, 2025)

**Continue with Claude 4.5 if**:
- F1 score >85% on pharmaceutical test set
- Customer satisfaction >8/10 on extraction quality
- Processing volume <120K documents/year
- Cost efficiency maintained

**Switch to BioBERT if**:
- Claude accuracy <85% F1 score
- Customer complaints about extraction quality
- Volume exceeds cost breakeven point
- Competitive pressure for "pharmaceutical-specific AI"

**Parallel Development**: SophieLogic‚Ñ¢ reasoning framework independent of entity extraction method

---

## Go-to-Market Strategy: Incubator-First (Accelerated)

### Strategic Rationale

**Why Incubators First:**

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: Complex agent coordination fails under load
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing with pharmaceutical scenarios, fallback to single-agent responses

**Risk**: Claude 4.5 accuracy insufficient for pharmaceutical decisions
**Mitigation**: Parallel BioBERT development ready for December decision point

**Risk**: 6-day development timeline too aggressive
**Mitigation**: 200 person-hour/day velocity with dual-team parallelization, proven AWS infrastructure

### Business Risks

**Risk**: Incubators prefer direct company model over platform approach
**Mitigation**: Validated pricing shows 98% cost savings, pilot programs prove value

**Risk**: Pharmaceutical industry slow adoption of AI decision support
**Mitigation**: Focus on early-stage companies with cash constraints, position as McKinsey replacement

**Risk**: Competitive response from established consulting firms
**Mitigation**: Technical moat through pharmaceutical-specific AI, regulatory compliance focus
